Read Me for QuoteBy Script

Overview
The `QuoteBy` script is a command-line tool designed for managing and retrieving quotes from a CSV file. It allows users to append new quotes, search for quotes by a character, or get a random quote. 

Prerequisites
- Bash environment
- `quotes.csv` file located in your home directory (`$HOME/quotes.csv`)

Setting Up
1. Ensure you have a `quotes.csv` file in your home directory. If not, create one using:

   echo "Character Name, Quote" > ~/quotes.csv
   echo "" >> ~/quotes.csv


2. Make the script executable:

   chmod +x /path/to/QuoteBy


Usage
The script has four primary functions:

1. Append a Quote
To add a new quote to your CSV file, use the command:

./QuoteBy append 'Character Name' 'New Quote'

Example:
./QuoteBy append 'Darth Vader' 'I am your father.'


This will add the quote "I am your father." under the character "Darth Vader" to your `quotes.csv` file.

2. Search for a Quote by Character
To find a quote by a specific character:

./QuoteBy search 'Character Name'

Example:
./QuoteBy search 'Darth Vader'

This will return a random quote from the character "Darth Vader" if available.

3. Get a Random Quote
To fetch a random quote from your CSV file:

./QuoteBy random


Example:
./QuoteBy random


This will display a random quote from any character.

4. Display Help
For usage instructions:

./QuoteBy help


or simply run:

./QuoteBy


Note
The script checks for the existence of `quotes.csv` in your home directory at startup. If the file does not exist, it will prompt you to create one.

Troubleshooting
- Ensure `quotes.csv` is correctly formatted and located in your home directory.
- Check if the script has executable permissions.

For more assistance, use `./QuoteBy help`.
